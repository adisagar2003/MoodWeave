# MoodWeave-MVP-Plan.md

## Core Concept
A mindful journaling app that fosters accountability through paired users. Users can journal individually but pair with a friend (invited) or a random partner for shared progress tracking. The "weave" theme symbolizes interconnected experiences—users see blended progress views to normalize varied emotional phases, reinforcing "you're not alone." Slogan: "Go fast alone, go further together."

## Niche
Mental wellness apps, targeting users seeking low-pressure community support for mindfulness habits, without the intensity of full social networks.

## Unique Selling Points (USPs)
- Modern, minimalist UI with glassmorphic or glow effects for a smooth, ethereal UX (e.g., translucent overlays, subtle animations, and soft lighting).
- User-customizable colors: Each user selects a personal color palette, which blends dynamically with their partner's in shared views for a harmonious, personalized interface.
- Multi-user collaboration: Real-time or daily synced progress views.
- Focus on empathy and shared growth, not competition.

## MVP Plan (Doable in 1 Month)
Assuming a small team (1-2 developers, 1 designer) using no-code/low-code tools like Bubble, Adalo, or Flutter for rapid prototyping, or a simple React Native/Expo setup for cross-platform (iOS/Android). Backend via Firebase for auth, database, and real-time syncing to keep it simple and scalable. Total scope: Focus on core journaling and pairing; avoid complex features like AI analytics or advanced matching algorithms initially. Incorporate space for custom UI elements in journaling, such as glassmorphic input fields and glow effects on trackers, while enabling user color selection during onboarding.

## MVP Features
Prioritize essentials for shipping fast. Features are grouped by user flow.

| Feature Category | Specific Features | Description | Priority (MVP Must-Have) |
|------------------|-------------------|-------------|--------------------------|
| User Onboarding & Auth | - Simple signup/login via email/Google/Apple.<br>- Profile setup: Username, optional bio/photo, daily mindfulness goal (e.g., "journal 5 mins/day").<br>- Color palette selection: Users pick a primary color (e.g., from a wheel or presets like serene blue, warm orange) to customize their UI. | Quick entry to reduce drop-off. No complex verification. Color choice sets base theme, with blends applied in paired modes. | High |
| Journaling Core | - Daily journal entry: Text input for reflections with glassmorphic styling (e.g., frosted glass input fields with subtle glow borders for focus).<br>- Mood selection: Slider or color-gradient picker (e.g., from calm green to intense red) instead of emojis, with optional custom labels.<br>- Streak tracker: Visual calendar with glow effects on active days and smooth animations for progress updates. | Basic mindfulness tool with room for custom UI enhancements. Entries private by default. Glassmorphism/glow ensures a premium, engaging feel without overwhelming simplicity. | High |
| Pairing & Accountability | - Invite friend: Share invite link/code via app or external (e.g., SMS/email).<br>- Random pairing: Opt-in queue; match based on simple criteria (e.g., time zone or goal similarity—keep algo basic, like FIFO).<br>- Blended progress view: Dashboard showing both users' streak calendars and mood trends (aggregated weekly), with UI dynamically mixing colors from both partners (e.g., gradients or overlays). Optional shared notes (e.g., encouragement messages). | Core hook. Progress visible only to pair; no full access to private journals. Limit to 1 pair per user in MVP. Blended colors reinforce the "weave" theme. | High |
| UI/UX Elements | - Minimalist design: Glassmorphic elements (e.g., semi-transparent cards) and glow accents for buttons/trackers, ensuring smooth transitions and haptic feedback.<br>- Notifications: Daily reminders to journal; alerts for partner's activity (e.g., "Your partner journaled today!"). | Keep design clean; use libraries like React Native Paper or CSS for glassmorphism/glow. User-selected colors apply globally, blending in shared screens for a cohesive, personalized experience. | Medium |
| Basic Analytics (Freemium Teaser) | - Personal mood graph: Simple line chart with glow highlights, showing mood over time.<br>- No advanced stats in MVP; tease premium for more. | Use Chart.js or similar for visuals, styled with user colors. | Medium |

## Out-of-Scope for MVP (Future Iterations)
- Advanced matching (e.g., AI-based on personality quizzes).
- Group pairing (beyond 1:1).
- Custom skins beyond basic color palettes (MVP uses user-selected colors with default glassmorphic/glow styles).
- In-app chat (use shared notes instead).
- Integrations (e.g., Apple Health, wearables).
- Admin tools for moderation (assume low user base initially).

## Development Timeline (1 Month Breakdown)
- Week 1: Wireframing, UI design (focus on glassmorphism/glow prototypes and color blending logic), setup auth/backend.
- Week 2: Build journaling core with custom UI elements (e.g., glassmorphic inputs, glow trackers) and personal dashboard.
- Week 3: Implement pairing logic, shared views with color blending, and mood picker refinements.
- Week 4: Testing, notifications, polish (ensure smooth UX across devices), app store submission prep.

## Tech Stack Suggestion
- Frontend: React Native for mobile, with libraries like react-native-glassmorphism or react-native-glow for effects, and color manipulation tools (e.g., tinycolor for blending).
- Backend: Firebase (auth, Firestore for data including color prefs, Cloud Functions for matching and real-time color sync).
- Estimated Cost: ~$0-200/month (Firebase free tier sufficient for MVP).

## Scope
- User Base Target: Start with 100-500 beta users via TestFlight/Google Play Beta.
- Platform: Mobile-only (iOS/Android); web version later.
- Data Privacy: Journals encrypted; shared data opt-in. Comply with GDPR/Apple guidelines.
- Metrics for Success: 70% retention after 7 days; 50% of users pairing within first week.
- Risks & Mitigations: Random pairing abuse—add report/block in MVP. Scalability—Firebase handles up to 100k users easily. UI rendering issues—test glassmorphism/glow on various devices for performance.

## Target Emotions Users Want to Feel
- Empowered & Connected: Seeing blended progress reduces isolation, fostering a sense of "we're in this together."
- Motivated without Pressure: Accountability via visibility, not judgment—users feel encouraged by shared phases (e.g., "It's okay if I'm in a dip; my partner was too last week.").
- Balanced & Calm: Customizable colors with glassmorphic/glow aesthetics evoke personalization and serenity; journaling promotes reflection, leaving users feeling grounded and hopeful.
- Accomplished: Streaks and mood graphs provide small wins, evoking pride and resilience.
